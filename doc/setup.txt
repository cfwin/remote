SETUP

++ i.mx50 webserver ++
++++++++++++++++++++++

I followed the instructions here:
	http://imxcommunity.org/forum/topics/using-imx-as-a-webserver

Get a new ltib installation and enable:
	[ ] php
	[ ] apache
	[ ] mysql

Deploy it on your board's SD card. I actually used NFS for the prototype.
Once the project is stable (and pretty) I will deploy it on the SD card.

++ Settings ++
++++++++++++++

There are two configuration files in the config/ directory:
	httpd.conf  rc.local

The changes to httpd.conf change the default directory. Specifically:

	DocumentRoot "/home/web"
	<Directory "/home/web">

This way the pages will be served from /home/web directory on the target
board. We also add remote.php to the default pages to serve list.

	DirectoryIndex index.html index.html.var index.php remote.php

The changes to rc.local set up the serial port and start the httpd daemon.

	if [ -e /dev/ttyUSB0 ]
	then
		echo "Configuring /dev/ttyUSB0"
		chmod a+w /dev/ttyUSB0
	fi

	if [ -e /home/web ]
	then
		echo "Starting apache..."
		/usr/bin/httpd &
	fi

To deploy, you need to copy the ui/web/* from the repository to the target's
/home/web directory. I accomplish this using the following command:

	cp ui/web/* ~/bsp/mx50/ltib/rootfs/home/web/

That's it!
