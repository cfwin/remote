Sharp Aquos Remote Control Project

Description
-----------
I have a Sharp Aquos LCD TV (model: LC-42D85U) which I bought without a remote.
They gave me a discount and I figured I could use the cable box's remote so why
not, right?

Well that worked for quite a long time until I cancelled my u-verse service and
decided to cut the cord. I bought an antenna for $7 which works great. However,
I now have no remote. I wanted to use my DVD player's remote but that only works
with Sony TVs (ggrrrr).

So, go buy a universal remote, right? Yeah, that's certainly an easy answer. But
I wanted to do a personal project while utilizing the awesome abilities of one
of the i.mx processors. This was a perfect opportunity.

The TV comes with an rs232 connection and a command set. The connection is 9600
baud 8N1.

This TV does not have IP control. So the idea is to connect an imx board to the
TV via the rs232, then connect that board to the network. The board runs a
webserver and has a "remote control" page. You can connect to this page from
your phone or your laptop and click on the buttons. Then magic will convert
these requests to rs232 commands to the TV.

I would like to design this as modular as possible so I can write separate TV
interfaces and talk to separate user interfaces. For example, one idea is to get
siriproxy to work in my home network, and control the TV using siri commands.

The high level design will hopefully look something like this:
